## Project Description
The game allows players to aim, choose the strength of their shot, and navigate the scene to hit the ball into the hole with as few strokes as possible. Key features of the simulator include:
- **Camera Movement** - freely move around the scene and aim
- **Textures and 3D Models** - realistically textured objects such as a golf club, ball, and windmill
- **Dynamic Lighting** - lighting simulation using Phong shading models
- **Game Physics** - ball movement based on real-world physics principles

## Libraries
- **GLEW**
- **GLM*
- **GLFW3**
  
## Controls
### Aiming Mode:
- **A** - move the camera left
- **D** - move the camera right
- **Space** - holding increases shot power; release to hit the ball

### Free Movement Mode:
- **W** - move forward
- **A/D** - move left/right
- **Mouse** - rotate the camera

### Other Controls:
- **C** - switch camera modes
- **R** - reset ball position
- **V** - toggle wireframe mode
- **Esc** - exit the game
